intervallic, neurological, or perceptual, is fundamental toward its
perception. In contrast, the parametric scaling presented here is
diagnostic in the analytic-theoretic sense but of potential value in
moving the psychological study of timbre to a higher cognitive level.
Of great interest is how orchestration interacts with other parameters.
Whether it is employed congruently or noncongruently with respect
to other parameters, timbral combinations produce strong aﬀects and
unmistakable moods. The parametric scaling hypothesized here thus
connects timbral structuration to the explanation of musical emotion.
Examples drawn from the classical orchestra repertory and from ﬁlm
music will demonstrate how timbral structures create mood and emo-
tional aﬀect, thereby shaping interparametric functions and thus our
aesthetic experiences.

Expressive Timing via Metric Hybrids
Fernando Benadon; American University, USA
PA098, Time: 16:30
Timelines with unequal subdivision counts can have similar onset dis-
tributions. Two such timelines form an analogous pair. Their resem-
blance makes it possible for one of the timelines to stand as an ex-
pressive transformation of the other. A distance score and an onset
displacement vector summarize the pair’s expressive properties. Ex-
amples are provided in two contexts: compositional and analytical. In
the former, gradual transformations result from tracing a path within
a network of timelines. In the latter, metric ambiguity results from an
analogous groove in Tinariwen’s “Mano Dayak.”

Implicit Learning of Rhythms Using a Serial Reaction

Expectations about musical structure may develop when regularities
that deﬁne particular musical idioms are learned implicitly through
mere exposure. Implicit learning (IL) occurs outside awareness and
without intention. Consequently, learners have diﬃculty reporting
the structural regularities of the material to which they have been
exposed. IL of tone structures and timbre sequences has been re-
ported but IL of rhythm has received less support. This paper reports
IL of rhythmic structure using an auditory Serial Reaction Time Task
(SRTT). Twenty-four participants identiﬁed pseudo-randomly chained
syllables (Pa, Ta, Ka) presented during training (Blocks 1–5) according
to a repeating pattern of inter-onset intervals (IOIs), giving the se-
quence a strongly-metrical (SM) rhythmic structure. A new SM struc-
ture was introduced in Block 6 (test) with Block 7 returning to the
training structure. Participants were not informed of the rhythmic
presentation of syllables. It was hypothesized that reaction times
(RTs) to syllables would decrease with training and increase at the
test block. As expected, RTs decreased across training blocks. An RT
increase at the test block was observed only for the shortest IOIs (700
ms). During the ﬁnal block, when the training structure was rein-
troduced, RTs to the shortest IOIs were signiﬁcantly faster relative
to the test block, indicating that performance in this ﬁnal block had
beneﬁted from training. Post-tests revealed that most participants
(88%) were unaware of the rhythmic presentation of syllables. These
ﬁndings provide preliminary evidence of IL of rhythmic structure. A
follow-up study investigating IL of ﬁgural grouping structure will be
discussed.

Liking and Memory for Music: Eﬀects of Eﬀortful
Encoding
Stephanie M. Stalinski, E. Glenn Schellenberg; University

PA115, Time: 16:30
Previous research has found that more-liked music excerpts are re-
membered better than excerpts that are disliked or responded to
neutrally. One possible explanation for this eﬀect is that excerpts
that are more-liked may be either spontaneously or eﬀortfully pro-
cessed in a deeper manner, leading to stronger memory traces and
better subsequent recognition. We investigated this possibility in two
experiments. Participants in both experiments initially heard 24 mu-
sic excerpts and rated how much they liked each excerpt on a scale
from 1 (dislike a lot) to 7 (like a lot). Subsequently, they heard the
same 24 excerpts as well as 24 previously unheard excerpts and made
recognition and conﬁdence judgments. Participants received no spe-
ciﬁc study instructions in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, participants
were told that their memory for the excerpts would be tested later and
that in order to remember the excerpts, they should visualize a de-
tailed and unique place where they would be likely to hear that kind of
music. Participants in the visualization experiment had better recog-
nition memory than participants without such instructions. In both
experiments, excerpts that were rated as more liked (ratings of 6 or 7)
were remembered better than excerpts that were disliked (ratings of
1 or 2) or neither liked nor disliked (ratings of 3–5), and the eﬀect of
liking on memory for music was not inﬂuenced by task instructions at
time of encoding. Because the liking eﬀect was not eliminated when
deep processing was encouraged for all items, music preferences ap-
pear to aﬀect memory processes at a more unconscious level.

Working Memory and the Perception of Hierarchical
Tonal Structures
Morwaread Farbood; New York University, USA

This paper examines how the limitations of working memory aﬀect
the perception of hierarchical tonal structures. Within this context, it
proposes some modiﬁcations to Lerdahl’s tonal tension model in or-
der to better explain certain experimental data. Data from a study
on the perception of musical tension were analyzed using regres-
sion analysis that took into account various parameters including har-
monic tension, melodic contour, and onset frequency. Descriptions
of how these features change over diﬀerent time spans ranging from
0.25 to 20 seconds were used in an attempt to identify the best pre-
dictors of the general tension curve. The results indicate that change
in harmony best ﬁt the tension data when the time diﬀerential was
between 10–12s, while other features best ﬁt the data at a time diﬀer-
ential of around 3s. This suggests that the memory of tonal regions
is retained for a considerably longer period of time than is the case
for other musical structures such as rhythm and melodic contour.

Previous research has shown that music training can positively
inﬂuence cognitive functions like verbal memory. However, it is
unclear, whether vocal training may have similar eﬀects as tuition
on musical instruments. Furthermore, questions arise as to whether
music training has any eﬀects on emotional processing including
stress regulation. The present investigation addresses longitudinal
eﬀects of a choral singing program on verbal memory and stress
regulation.
Forty-four 5th -graders (29 female) participated. Group A children (n

Spontaneous vs Intentional Entrainment to a Musical
Beat

PA134, Time: 16:30
We compared spontaneous vs intentional entrainment of rocking to
a musical pulse. Participants sat in a rocking chair and rocked. As a
cover task, in 13 of the 15 trials, they were asked to memorize ﬁve
words and recall them after 45 seconds of rocking. In eleven of the
trials, participants were exposed to a steady drum/cymbal beat. The
tempo of the musical pulse either increased or decreased by 2 bpm
on each trial (between 60 to 80 bpm) or was ordered randomly. Two
baseline measurements of rocking tempo were taken at the beginning
of the experiment and two more at the end.
Thirteen participants were instructed to rock at a comfortable pace
(spontaneous condition); eighteen were instructed to rock with the
beat (intentional condition). The motion was recorded at 60 Hz us-
ing a magnetic tracking system. We examined the synchronization
of participants’ back-and-forth movements in the rocking chair with
the musical pulse. In the spontaneous entrainment condition, partici-
pants showed no evidence of synchronization, although they did rock
faster with music than without it. In the intentional condition, some
participants entrained to the actual beat, others doubled the beat, and
others showed behavior that was more complex and not always sta-
ble. Overall, evidence for entrainment was not clear, but those in the
intentional condition were clearly aﬀected by the musical beat.

A Kinematic Model for Perceived Musical Tempo

Final Ritardando with its dynamic range of temporal variability is an
ideal candidate for studying expressive timing in music. There have
been attempts to model ritardando with reference to parameters of
physical action; however, second-order systems have never been pro-
posed as a possible kinematic approach. Herein we oﬀer a second-
order diﬀerential equation modeling approach, used to describe a va-
riety of real world physical systems such as diﬀusion processes, con-
trol of electrical/mechanical devices and human arm/hand/leg move-
ments to capture the temporal pattern of ﬁnal ritardando. In the ﬁrst
experiment, the model parameters were changed iteratively to sim-
ulate several second-order systems until we ﬁnd the system output
that was closest to the data proﬁle. The model was shown to pro-
duce a good ﬁt with the deceleration curves generously shared by
Friberg & Sundberg (1999). In the second experiment, we provided
a perceptual evaluation of the model by synthesizing music based
on modiﬁed model parameters. Damping ratio is particularly impor-
tant as a mathematical means of expressing the level of damping in
the system; hence a listening experiment was carried out to assess
preferred damping levels (curvatures of deceleration) among various
ritardandi samples. The resulting samples diﬀered only with respect
to ﬁnal temporal pattern; and they were rated by musically experi-
enced judges, based on how musical and aesthetically pleasing the
performance of the ritardando sounds. Slightly under-damped ver-
sions received highest ratings, indicating a common preference for a
particular shape of motion. Results provided further support for the
common analogy between music and physical motion.

The temporal attribute of sound plays an important role in timbre
perception. In this work, we investigated the relevance between per-
ceived timbre and neural activity when a sound’s temporal attribute
is manipulated. We focused on the eﬀect that a quickly decaying
sound with a strong attack changes its timbre dramatically when
played backward; we presented such forward- and backward-playing
sounds to our participants, and measured the perceived timbre dis-
similarity and EEG response. The register and instrument type were
also varied for comparison. In the perceptual experiment, the stimuli
were presented in pairs, and the participants rated the dissimilarity
using numerical scaling. The dimensions of temporal attribute and
register contributed strongly to the perceived dissimilarity, whereas
the dimension of instrument type contributed less. In the EEG
experiment, the participants listened to the stimuli sounds passively,
and we analyzed the neural responses using linear discriminant
classiﬁcation. The stimuli grouped by temporal attribute showed
the highest classiﬁcation rate, followed by instrument type and
register, which indicates that among the three dimensions, changes
in temporal attribute produce the most distinct neural activity pat-
tern. These results point to a possible correlation between perceived
timbre diﬀerence and neural response due to changes in the temporal
attribute.

Closing, Time: 16:30
Music is commonly regarded as being primarily an auditory phe-
nomenon, and the bulk of research on music perception focuses
exclusively on this sensory modality. Only recently have the multi-
modal aspects of music processing gained signiﬁcant attention. In
addition to the auditory, other sensory modalities such as visual,
tactile, and proprioceptive, play a signiﬁcant role in the processing
of musical information. A common feature of the latter modalities is
that they rely on corporeal movement.
Examples of the important role of movement in music are abundant.
For instance, in most cultures music is associated with dance. Fur-
thermore, we tend to move while listening to music, in particular

An Evolutionary Theory of Music Origins: From 4
Million Years Ago to Musical Chills
Mark S. Riggle; Causal Aspects, USA
PO221, Poster
We develop a theory framework showing how and why music evolved.
We postulate the existence of a neural mechanism causing pleasure
from entrained motion with rhythmic sounds. The postulate starts
a viable evolutionary path leading to music pleasure, including
emotions. If entrainment to rhythmic sounds is pleasurable, and
supplying pleasure confers a reproductive advantage, then males
with the ability and motivation to create rhythmic sounds gain a
reproductive advantage, and this strongly selects on ability and

from performance judgments, whether “good” conducting elevates
the evaluation of a performance or whether “poor” conducting un-
dermines what might have been an otherwise positive evaluation. (3)
Acknowledging that conducting encompasses the visual expression of
numerous musical characteristics (e.g., tempo, articulation), it would
be useful to examine each of these in isolation to determine whether
the impact of such a broad construct as “expressivity” is attributable
to particular constituent components.

Cadenza as Music Projection of Rhyme in Serbian
Romantic Lied
Milena Petrovic; University of Arts Belgrade, Serbia
PO226, Poster
The form of improvised, non-written cadenza could correspond to
principle of oral poetry tradition. During the 19th century the impro-
vised cadenza disappeared and the oral tradition and its propagation
was over resulting with the predominance of rhyme. Cadenza as
the end of phrase, movement or composition could correspond to
rhyme principle of verse ending which helps in verse memorization.
Such hierarchical structure of cadenza and rhyme reﬂected in visual
notation and their audio perception inﬂuenced some authors to
consider rhyme as graphic or music issue. At the epoch when
rudiments of polyphony originated we can ﬁnd rudiments of rhyme.
But, in the Ancient Greek poetry we can not ﬁnd rhymes, as well as
in the Ancient Greek music we can not hear harmony.
Rhyme is equivalent to music tonal center and corresponds to the
central principle at the same way the focus of tonal harmony is
presented by a basic chord. In Serbian Romantic Lied rhyme pro-
duces music repetitions in cadenzas, while patriotic words require
semantic and harmonic relationship. Composers sometimes digress
from regular word accentuation and meaning due to rigid meter
of rhyme. Frequently, rhyme is settled in “question-answer” music
relation, sometimes highlighted by diﬀerent harmonies. Composers
of late Romanticism settled rhyme in a modern harmonic language
and oﬀenly disturbed strict metric rhyme in order to respect word
accent and word meaning.
